In search of configurational genetic codes of cultural artifacts.
</h2>

<p>
In the vast expanse of the digital age, architects have emerged as our modern trailblazers. 
They are not merely designers of structures, but navigators, charting a course through the labyrinth of data to uncover meaningful patterns. 
They serve as the connective tissue, joining the dots and helping us make sense of this complex, information-laden world.
</p>

<p>
Yet their role extends further. Today’s architects also act as algorithm creators, directly involved in constructing 
the instructions and procedures 
that mold our reality. These algorithms serve as our lenses, 
the filters through which we perceive and understand our world. They are not merely part of our cognitive framework – they are its very backbone.
</p>

<p>
With computational tools becoming increasingly accessible and popular, the personal element in architecture has ascended to prominence. 
To think collectively, we must first be individuals, each bringing our unique sets of knowledge and experiences to the table. 
This personal influence permeates the algorithms we create and how they are applied, causing the collective outcome to reflect our individual inputs.
</p>

<p>
This blog post, a distillation of my thesis, invites you on an exploration into the captivating intersection of algorithmic thinking, 
informational abundance, and human sensibility. 
It’s a journey into the core of architecture, where creativity meets code and where the language of programming fuses with the language of design.
</p>

<p>
Together, we will explore the fascinating world of algorithmic tools and their transformative impact on architectural practices. 
We will delve into how these tools are empowering 
us to redefine design and construct a new reality. So, buckle up and join me on this expedition into the brave new world of architecture.

An Investigation of Theory and Prototype
</h3>

<p>
Mark Rakatansky once said, “All architects are fabricators.” This sentiment rings 
particularly true today, in an era where architects’ tools have expanded beyond physical materials to include the abstract language of algorithms.
</p>

<p>
In this exploration, we are part theorist, part practitioner. We delve into the theoretical underpinnings of our field, 
examining ideas and concepts through essays and articles that revolve around the core topic of this thesis: the intersection of architecture 
and algorithmic design. These theoretical explorations are then manifested 
in the real world through a series of prototypes, tangible embodiments of abstract concepts, selected from a universe of potential solutions.
</p>

<p>
This two-pronged approach serves dual purposes. First, it allows us to bridge the gap between the abstract world of mathematics and 
the concrete world of architectural design, facilitating the translation of computational methods into tangible outputs. To accomplish this, 
we need a deep understanding of how these concepts interact with the intricate 
tapestry of social and cultural meanings we navigate daily. We create abstractions to model our world and compare various models to gain insights.
</p>

<p>
The second purpose is rooted in the narrative of architecture. Rather than focusing strictly on optimization, 
we embrace the fluidity of design. We mix, mutate, morph, and compare, always seeking the experimental and the radical, 
the playful and the exciting. The story of architecture is one of constant evolution, and algorithms are the newest characters in our tale.

Definitions of Space
</h3>

<p>
Understanding our surroundings begins with the definition of space. Our conception of space forms a framework that facilitates 
the construction of models to comprehend the world. The scientific definitions of space have not only paved the way for numerous 
scientific discoveries, but they’ve also steered the socio-cultural evolution of our civilization. A comprehensive architectural 
definition of space is paramount 
in making informed design decisions. The perception of space-time by an architect-programmer profoundly influences their approach to design.
</p>

<p>
Take for example, the definition of space provided by the widely-used online resource, Wikipedia. It 
describes space as “the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.” 
This is merely one of many possible definitions, underscoring the amorphous and complex nature of defining space.
</p>

<p>
This exploration will not delve into all possible definitions of space. Instead, it will focus on the latest 
insights within the architectural, configurational, 
computational, and geometric domains. The outcome is a transdisciplinary theoretical-prototypical investigation into the nature of space.
</p>

<p>
In this context, a few points of clarification are necessary:
</p>

<ol>
<li>“Space” refers to the intuitive understanding each person has when they find themselves within a spatial environment.</li>
<li>“Space” also pertains to the collective notions that arise when contemplating the nature of space or simply existing within it.</li>
<li>This exploration does not attempt to address the historical transformation of the concept of space.</li>
<li>The cultural meaning of spatial configurations transcends the mere physical, encompassing neural activity patterns.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Our basic postulates regarding space include:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Space is the quality and quantity of relations between active points of a network.</li>
<li>Space is the amount and accuracy of data collected at a certain point in the space-time continuum.</li>
<li>Space is the neural activity at a certain point in space-time continuum.</li>
<li>Space is the ability to evolve within a certain space-time continuum.</li>
</ol>

    By considering “Related Forms” from D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson’s “On Growth and Form” alongside Bill Hillier’s 
    “Notional Courtyard Buildings with Different Fenestrations” from “Space is the Machine,” we are exposed to two 
    compelling viewpoints on space and form. Thompson’s seminal work illustrates how mathematical patterns and physical 
    laws shape natural forms, suggesting that similar principles may influence architectural design and the arrangement of space. 
    In contrast, Hillier presents a triadic perspective on space in architecture, focusing on patterns of physical elements, spatial 
    elements, and depth, as illustrated through justified graphs. Both works underline the significance of form and pattern in the built 
    environment, albeit from different angles. Thompson’s work emphasizes the value of biomimicry and the influence of natural laws, 
    while Hillier’s stresses the importance of spatial patterns and depth. 
    Together, they offer a rich, multifaceted understanding of space and form, applicable to both architecture and broader spatial sciences.

<h3 class="paragraph-title">
Location based data—application in design.
</h3>

<p>
The impact of widely collected data on the field of architecture will almost certainly lead to profound changes in the coming decades.
</p>

<p>
The availability of location-based-data of individuals offers not only a means of acquiring empirical behavioral feedback but also 
offers the opportunity to incorporate the information retrieved from large data sets into the configurational genes of artifacts. 
This principle applies whether it is quantitative, relational, geometrical, topological or any 
other type of retrievable information. This, in turn, allows location-based-data to influence the evolution of architectural/configurational species.
</p>

<p>
Information on the geographical position of mobile devices can provide valuable data about the movement patterns of individuals and 
groups, or types of activities performed in different parts of buildings allowing adjustments of usage predictions that were made in the 
design phase. But perhaps more importantly, it could also provide real time data for adaptable architectural artifacts. 
The performance of responsive architecture depends greatly on the quantity and quality of data collected and processed. In this way, it requires 
architects and scripters to incorporate methods and ways of using data into genetic codes (or configurational properties) of responsive artifacts.
</p>

<p>
For instance, in a society looking for ways to minimize its environmental impacts, proper incorporation 
of location-based data into the genetic codes of its cultural artifacts can have an immense positive impact on its sustainable existence.
</p>

<p>
Within the thematic scope of this thesis 
information gathered around a certain point in space represents a potential of this space to transform, evolve, or morph its surroundings.

    larger narrative about how these spaces are inhabited and navigated. These data, often at the heart of data privacy debates, also 
    become instrumental in deepening our understanding of spatial typologies. The patterns of congregation and movement revealed by these data 
    points echo Thompson’s idea of form influenced by growth and Hillier’s interpretation of spatial patterns. In this interplay between data and 
    space, we see a compelling overlap of 
    digital privacy concerns and architectural inquiries, reminding us of the dynamic, evolving nature of space in our increasingly digitized world.

Unlocking Design Potential with Configurational Codes
</h3>

<p>
Just like a living organism is defined by its genetic makeup, we can think of artifacts as having their own ‘genetic codes’. 
These codes form the blueprint of an artifact’s properties and behavior. 
Inspired by the work of Bill Hillier in Space Syntax, we’re exploring this idea further and using it to understand and create architectural forms.
</p>

<p>
At its heart, this approach views an artifact as a blend of physical, social, and cultural information. 
It’s a way of seeing our surroundings as a network of interconnected systems, each one shaped by our spatial, social, and cultural experiences.
</p>

<p>
Our goal in this journey is two-fold. First, we aim to understand how algorithms can be used to solve architectural problems. 
Second, we want to identify the ‘genetic codes’ of artifacts and use them to create new architectural forms. 
Essentially, we’re aiming to build a toolkit of methods and codes to tackle a variety of architectural situations.
</p>

<p>
We start this exploration by examining the logic of space itself. By dissecting the relationships between different elements of space, 
we’re 
able to identify and store geometrical and topological properties, giving us the ‘genetic makeup’ of what we call a “configurational creature.”
</p>

<p>
When we talk about ‘genetic codes’ of artifacts, we’re referring to two distinct ideas. 
The first idea is about the rules that define how an object is constructed. These are the basic, quantifiable elements. 
The second idea, more abstract and intriguing, is about the rules that define the essence of an artifact. 
This is where the creative magic happens. 
It’s about understanding the character of a place at a deeper level, and using that understanding to shape innovative designs.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a simplified version of the process we’re following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract the ‘configurational genes’ of existing designs, taking 
into consideration attributes such as angles, areas, volumes, distances, metrics, and integration, along with the social implications of the design.</li>
<li>Archive these ‘configurational genes’ within the ‘genotype class’ of an entity.</li>
<li>Visualize an artifact as a self-organizing system of interconnected entities.</li>
<li>Formulate an ‘Environmental Genotype’—a blueprint for expressing the inherent traits of an artifact’s ‘genotype’.</li>
<li>Compute the emergent traits for a unique design context, fostering adaptation and self-assembly.</li>
</ol>

    traits within this cultural artifact. Much like unravelling the genetic code of a living organism, 
    this two-fold analysis provides us with a deeper understanding of the underlying structures that mold and characterize the urban space.
    </p>
</div>

<h3 class="paragraph-title">Exploring Algorithmic Methods: A Multifaceted Approach</h3>

<p>
This exploration begins with evolutionary algorithms, a heuristic approach inspired by biological evolution, as 
presented in Daniel Shiffman’s book. These algorithms serve as an optimization tool, using ‘genes’ and complex fitness 
functions for problem-solving. Initial tests with simple 
objects such as cubes suggested its potential application to complex architectural problems where solutions aren’t easily defined.
</p>

<p>
The approach then extends to the concept of autonomous agents, viewing basic elements of a configuration as such. 
This perspective aids data organization and opens up possibilities for employing computational paradigms like swarm intelligence. 
It also simulates various behavioral interactions crucial to socio-spatial systems or heuristic solutions 
for complex configuration issues. In this context, the steering behavior of each moving object is optimized using an evolutionary algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Simultaneously, the exploration employs physics engines to add another dimension to form finding. 
This introduces a playful yet precise element to the design process, the accuracy of which is directly proportional to the scripter 
or designer’s algorithmic skills. Visualization of the parameters of resulting forms and their relationship to the applied rules enhances the process.
</p>

<p>
The concept of ‘particle systems’ comes into play, understanding particles as moving agents, and agents as 
basic building blocks of a configuration. This understanding allows control over the behavior of multiple agents, 
leading to the emergence of complex architectural patterns. Cellular automata, 
despite their unpredictability, prove useful in architectural design as they help generate novel and unpredictable spatial organizations.
</p>

<p>
Neural networks, algorithmic paradigms mimicking brain behavior, provide probabilistic solutions. 
Simple models are applicable for solving straightforward problems, as demonstrated in a pattern recognition 
example based on the Nature of Code. However, complex deep 
learning pipelines offer the most promise for architectural design, although a detailed exploration is beyond the scope of this thesis.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the investigation culminates in ‘vectorial evolution’. The notion of a vector cloud as a means for an artifact’s 
morphing is derived from the idea of space as a socio-cultural field with transformative potential. 
Spatial objects have genetic codes determining their configuration. In this context, the grid is seen as an environment 
influencing appearance, creating a negotiation between the configurational creature’s desires and the surroundings’ demands. 
Notably, this algorithmic paradigm is easier to implement than devising a 
complicated fitness function and allows active human participation, resulting in a truly collaborative human-machine output.

<h3 class="paragraph-title">Context: The Evolution of Algorithmic Thinking in Design</h3>

<p>
The odyssey of algorithmic thinking in design has witnessed an impressive array of projects and innovations. 
These pivotal landmarks have transitioned us from rudimentary design techniques to 
the sophisticated computational design methods we use today. Below is a personal list of waypoints that have accompanied me on my journey.
</p>

<p>
Before the digital era, architects relied on manual drawings to create designs. Even though mathematical algorithms were part of 
architecture, the complexity manageable was limited by human computational ability. However, the rise of computers and 
the introduction of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) in the late 20th century marked a turning point. This period saw projects like 
the ‘Processing Project’, a key instance of the rising prominence of coding in design, signaling a shift towards accessibility 
and democratization of open-source code. These efforts heralded a new wave of artistic exploration at 
the confluence of art, architecture, and algorithms, challenging the dominance of traditional methodologies.
</p>

<p>
Despite this shift, the tried-and-tested approaches to generating architectural plans and analyzing forms still 
hold their ground. Visionaries such as Ludger Hovestadt have been instrumental in weaving algorithmic thinking 
into the fabric of design, laying the groundwork for tools and strategies that are vital today. The array of 
spin-offs initiated by Hovestadt, including “Digitales Bauen” and “Design to Production,” 
demonstrate the practical application of these techniques, emphasizing the crucial role of outcome evaluation.
</p>

<p>
By the late 1990s and early 2000s, parametric design started to gain traction. This led to a more significant 
evolution into the domain of generative design and optimization. It was during this period that 
Karl Sims’ ‘Galapagos’ project came to the fore, as an exciting exploration of the fusion of natural 
and computational principles. This venture simulated the growth and 
evolution of digital organisms, unveiling unexpected solutions that arise when nature and computation dance in tandem.
</p>

<p>
With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a new narrative is being carved out for the application of 
algorithms in visual arts and architecture. Generative Adversarial Neural Networks in architectural design, as 
demonstrated by Stanislas Chaillou, exemplify this trend. Machine learning is opening avenues for more nuanced 
human-machine interactions, reshaping generative art and AI applications. In the context of AI, as Mark 
Rakatansky’s “Desire and Doubt” explores, we’re potentially better equipped to pursue the elusive ‘whole’ in our creations.
</p>

<p>
To sum it up, the journey of algorithmic methods in architectural design has morphed from a fascination with the optimization capabilities of 
genetic algorithms into a more sophisticated understanding of human-machine collaboration. Our initial 
fascination has blossomed into an appreciation for how these methodologies possess transformative potential. 
As machine learning sets the stage for the next leap in this evolutionary journey, the future of design is certainly brimming with promise.

    transformative impact of algorithms on creative processes, reshaping traditional boundaries in the realms of art and architecture.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="paragraph-title">Experiment Results</h3>

<p>
This exploration dives headfirst into the sea of computational and configurational genetic codes, painting 
a vibrant picture of artifacts not as singular, static entities, but as a dynamic network of relationships – a 
conceptual shift that resonates with the very essence of computational thinking. Here, the focus isn’t on a specific location, but on the whole 
interconnected web of potential sites that meet a given set of criteria – much like an algorithm scanning through an array of possibilities.
</p>

<p>
The concept of “configurational genes” is introduced, offering a fresh take on the relational ties between an artifact’s elements. 
By transforming a 
system into discrete parts and modeling the connections between them, we can uncover these hidden genes from existing artifacts.
</p>

<p>
Two distinct types of sites were chosen for this exploratory journey: a market square and a playground. 
These sites, though seemingly different, both spark a sense of playfulness and curiosity. The ultimate litmus test for 
this approach lies in its ability to facilitate successful “gene” 
crossovers between different configurational entities, requiring these genetic traits to be translated into an algorithmic language.
</p>

<p>
In choosing the sites, elements such as simplicity, public access, and potential for data collection came into play. 
The playful, socializing potential of the outputs was also a key consideration. The exploration involved analyzing
 multiple market squares and playgrounds in Vienna, 
distilling their genetic codes, observing their physical manifestations, and applying an interactive selection genetic algorithm.
</p>

<p>
This study, unlike other algorithmic architecture projects, is not an attempt to craft a toolbox or framework. 
Instead, it is a personal exploration of the field, a quest for novel abstractions and a re-evaluation of existing methods. 
It’s a bridge between the architectural and the algorithmic, the past and the future, and despite exploring multiple algorithmic 
paradigms, it maintains an aura of playfulness and unpredictability. It’s a testing ground for a simple neural network, a stepping 
stone for future ventures into the depths of deep learning. And at its core, it favors raw geometrical, 
topological, and configurational information over image representations, heralding a unique approach to learning and working materials.

</div>

<h3 class="paragraph-title">Final Thoughts and Further Horizons</h3>

<p>
This journey has been a deep dive into the world of algorithmic methodologies, charting a course for the integration of 
algorithmic principles into the creative process of designing cultural artifacts. Along the way, a search was conducted for 
the perfect spatial models to serve as a canvas for these applications. The initial leg of this journey involved putting a 
variety of algorithmic paradigms through their paces, testing their suitability to address simple architectural challenges. 
Through a series of iterative experiments, a selection of the most fitting algorithms was made, forming a pivotal part of the ongoing dialogue 
between the creation of configurational models of space (configurational cultural artifacts) and the hunt for potent algorithmic methods.
</p>

<p>
This journey culminated in a freewheeling exploration of the design space, creatively tweaking and twisting the theoretical presumptions 
of Bill Hillier’s configurational theory of space. The emergence of the concept of cultural artifacts’ 
genetic codes enabled a translation of different artifacts’ configurational properties into interchangeable and mutable information chunks.
</p>

<p>
As we round off this exploration, it’s crucial to underline its intensely personal nature. There’s no one-size-fits-all 
approach to transposing the presented genetic codes of artifacts into their phenotypical manifestations. 
Each architect should not only craft their 
unique methodological toolkit but also recognize that every project requires a custom-built framework.
</p>

<p>
The power to script one’s tools bestows the creator with nearly complete control over the design, fabrication, 
and maintenance of artifacts. This approach ushers in boundless opportunities for collective configurational endeavors 
and co-creation. These sets of instructions are highly translatable, and burrowing deep into the intrinsic 
configurational properties of artifacts (their genetic codes) lifts creative manipulation to a whole new level.

Yet, it’s important to acknowledge the limitations of the tested algorithms. More complex problems that evade simple 
categorization, or are inherently non-optimizable or tough to define, call for a different kind of 
algorithmic-architectural toolkit. Machine learning pipelines 
hold potential to cultivate the type of symbiotic relationship between humans and machines that could prove fruitful.

As the creative spirit in this realm continues to evolve, some have likened the process of design to playing an instrument. 
This exploration has fueled a continuous motivation to seek out those dreamt-of machines, reflecting our ongoing evolution in the field.
